### Introduction & Motivation

This is the love child of Mistral AI and AI task tracking.

Tasktral makes daily standups for developers feel like a walk in the park by automatically tracking and recording devs key tasks throughout the day, providing insights into their productivity and effectiveness.

### How It Works

Getting started with Tasktral is simple and intuitive:

1. At the beginning of your day, open the software and input your main tasks
2. Tasktral automatically tracks your progress throughout the day
3. The AI recognizes whether you're working on assigned tasks or getting sidetracked
4. At day's end, get a clear summary of your activities and productivity insights
